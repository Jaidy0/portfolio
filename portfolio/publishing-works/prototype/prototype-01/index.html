        <p>
          JEJU ISLAND IN 1979 WAS BARREN LAND, COVERED ONLY IN ROCKS AND WHIPPED BY WILD WINDS FROM THE SURROUNDING OCEAN. IN THE BEGINNING, IT WAS NO-MAN’S-LAND EVEN BY LOCAL STANDARDS.
          USING MODERN TECHNOLOGY TO MAXIMIZE ALL ASPECTS OF THE ISLAND’S NATURAL RESOURCES AT EVERY STEP IN THE CULTIVATION PROCESS, OSULLOC HAS ESTABLISHED A HIGH STANDARD FOR QUALITY AND SERVICE.

          CALLED “ISLAND OF THE GODS” BY THE LOCAL PEOPLE, OVAL-SHAPED JEJU ISLAND IS LOCATED IN THE SOUTH OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA. IT WAS FORMED APPROXIMATELY 2 MILLION YEARS AGO WHEN AN UNDERWATER VOLCANO ERUPTED.
          IN 2007, VOLCANIC JEJU ISLAND, WITH ITS ICONIC LAVA TUBES, WAS RECOGNIZED AS A UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITE DUE TO ITS UNIQUE FEATURES.

          WE ARE PROUD PIONEERS IN PRESERVING KOREAN TEA CULTURE, WHICH HAS EXISTED FOR NEARLY 2,000 YEARS.
          TEAS WERE FIRST ENJOYED BY KOREA’S ROYAL FAMILY, MONKS, AND NOBLES. THROUGHOUT HISTORY, TEAS HAVE ALSO PLAYED A PART IN MANY ASPECTS OF KOREAN LITERATURE, POETRY, DRAMA, ART, AND MUSIC. PEOPLE SERVE TEA TO WELCOME GUESTS.
          ONCE IT WAS INTRODUCED INTO KOREAN CULTURE, TEA GRADUALLY BECAME AN IMPORTANT PART OF DAILY RITUALS AT EVERY SOCIETAL LEVEL.
