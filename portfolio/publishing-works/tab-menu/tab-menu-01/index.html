              It is a highly absorbent water-soluble substance used to prevent dryness by moisturizing the skin or hair. The stratum corneum of the skin has natural moisturizing factors, which play a physiological important role in protecting the skin. When your skin's physiological function decreases due to age or in dry seasons, you should artificially protect your skin. Moisturizers are added to cosmetics to protect the skin's moisture.

              Ultraviolet UV rays are shorter than purple rays of visible light. It is an ultraviolet UVA with a relatively long wavelength, divided into ultraviolet UVB with a medium wavelength and ultraviolet UVC with short wavelengths. About 50% of UVA penetrates the epidermis and dermal reticulum, causing blackening, and deforms collagen and elastin to cause skin aging, causing wrinkles, and is involved in light-sensitive skin diseases.
